## Prancing Unicorn

### Spec:
Your task is make an easter egg, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)#Software) on our www.atlassian.com homepage.  When a visitor presses the “u” key on their keyboard an image of a unicorn should dance across the screen from left to right.  Use your favorite unicorn image (from the internet, don’t send us the unicorn image), and make sure you clean up the DOM after unicorn has left the screen.  
You should send us your Javascript code in text.  We will take your text of your code and paste it into the Chrome Javascript Developer Console (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/ ) and hit enter.  

### TODOS:
  * INSERT A UNICORN IMAGE.
  * Adjust top margin to align with the center of the window.
  * Keep the div in the center of the view port when when scrolling.
  * Update event handler to reflect specs.
  * Clean up the dom once the div leaves the view port.
  * Add rotation / pivot to make the image look like its dancing.
