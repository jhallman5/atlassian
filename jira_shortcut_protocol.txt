Hypothesis:
From https://www.atlassian.com/, too many redirects can be a deterrent/overwhelming when shopping for a project management tool.

Proposed Solution:
Create a more direct path to the Jira signup page.

The Plan:
Create a button directly on top of 'Get started for free' with the text 'Go agile with Jira for free'.
The href should point to https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/try
Update 'Get started for free' button's text to 'Learn about our other products'.
Update 'Learn about our other products' button's class to reflect a "learn more" button.


Main Metrics:
  * How many users end up buying Jira compared to the original layout

Side Metrics:
  * How many users end up buying ANY software.
  * How quickly do they sign up.
  * URL route taken for successful / unsuccessful sales ( which pages did they visit and what were the results ).

Experiment Variation:
  Send out the above to 10% of users
  Remove the 'or checkout our other products' button, send out to 10% of users
  Keep 80% of visitor experiences the same until we can analyze some data.
  Run for 2 weeks
